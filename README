First Prototype Edition:
This is a first edition of the Ramsey Systems prototype for the AI research project, it contains a custom FAISS index and uses the OpenAI API within a flask app.

Instructions for Use:
- You can create an OpenAI API key to place in .env and .config here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

- Best query for the story page is: 'Generate a unique json instance of a diabetic patient using the schema and example provided'
- Best query for the timeline page is: 'Create a timeline for the provided patient story using the schema and example provided'
    - IMPORTANT: The current FAISS index does not have a large number of examples so there may be times where the AI will generate a response which is either not valid/ not relevant, if this occurs just re-submit your query and it should be fixed.

Loading Story:
- For stories which are loaded they should be formatted in a similar style to the one below (including the square and brackets)
